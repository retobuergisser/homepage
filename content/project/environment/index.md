Two of the most pressing challenges governments face nowadays are rising economic inequality and climate change. As indicated by mounting media attention and political protest, both issues have the potential to cause significant political disruption in the future if they are not being addressed with substantial policy interventions. Reducing economic inequality and combatting climate change are not only two strongly supported policy goals, but they will also require significant public investments. In times of limited fiscal resources, governments struggle to raise additional revenues needed to finance both, making trade-offs between generally supported policy goals likely.

Transitioning from fossil fuels and nuclear energy to an age of renewable energy is a challenge for many industrialized countries. Despite being the most effective and economically efficient instrument to generate continuous and long-term incentives for environmentally-friendly innovation and practices, green taxes are particularly difficult to implement politically. Scholars have demonstrated that the cost perceptions that characterize incentive-based policy instruments are a fundamental reason for their unpopularity. Citizens assume that they must choose between a better environment in the future and a higher real income today, and they often tend to prefer the latter. Thus, the nature of green taxes leads to a situation in which the costs related to a policy proposal are immediately tangible and visible for individual households, whereas the potential benefits of these instruments are much less so. Building on original survey experimental data from Switzerland, we investigate how information on green tax efficacy, party elite cues, and compensation mechanisms through revenue recycling can increase popular support for green taxes. These results produce relevant policy implications regarding the design of ecological taxes and the role of knowledge and beliefs for environmental attitudes and behavior. 

In a previous project with Klaus Armingeon, I have studied how citizens decide if they have to choose between goals they support in principle, such as spending on efforts to reduce inequality and channeling resources toward initiatives to protect the environment? We discuss three major factors that help explain this choice – information, self-interest, and ideological orientation. Our experimental study shows that information is not a significant determinant of such choices, and that ideology is only important as long as there are no conflicting goals. Once citizens have to decide between redistribution and environmental protection, myopic self-interest trumps all other theoretically relevant variables mentioned in the literature.
