abstract: Reducing economic inequality and combatting climate change are two
  strongly supported policy goals, but they will require significant public
  investments. In times of limited fiscal resources, governments struggle to
  raise additional revenues needed to finance both, making trade-offs between
  generally supported policy goals likely. But how do citizens decide if they
  have to choose between goals they support in principle, such as spending on
  efforts to reduce inequality and channeling resources toward initiatives to
  protect the environment? We discuss three major factors that help explain this
  choice â€“ information, self-interest, and ideological orientation. Our
  experimental study shows that information is not a significant determinant of
  such choices, and that ideology is only important as long as there are no
  conflicting goals. Once citizens have to decide between redistribution and
  environmental protection, myopic self-interest trumps all other theoretically
  relevant variables mentioned in the literature.
