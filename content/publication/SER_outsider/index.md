abstract: Postindustrialization and occupational change considerably complicate
  partisan politics of the welfare state. This article asks about the
  determinants of contemporary social democratic labor market policy. We argue
  that the composition of their support base is a critical constraint and
  empirically demonstrate that the actual electoral clout of different voter
  segments decisively affects policy outcomes under left government. We
  calculate the electoral relevance of two crucial subgroups of the social
  democratic coalition, labor market insiders and outsiders, in 19 European
  democracies and combine these indicators with original data capturing the
  specific content of labor market reforms. The analysis reveals considerable
  levels of responsiveness and demonstrates that relative electoral relevance is
  consistently related to policy outcomes. Social democratic governments with a
  stronger support base among the atypically employed push labor market reforms
  on their behalf—and vice versa. Our findings have important implications for
  our understanding of policy-making in postindustrial societies.
