abstract: "The COVID-19 crisis presents a unique opportunity to study how public
  opinion towards the redistributive role of the state reacts to a major
  economic shock. The pandemic and the measures taken to stop it exposed
  citizens to both increased fiscal constraint and heightened redistributive
  capacity: historical drops in GDP (and fiscal revenue) coincided with
  unprecedented increases in public spending on healthcare provisions and social
  policy, as well as staggering amounts of financial liquidity provided to
  hard-hit economic sectors. How did this affect citizens’ attitudes towards
  redistribution and their assessments of the capacity of the state to
  intervene? To tackle these questions, we rely on a two-wave panel survey
  fielded in Germany, Sweden, and Spain in late 2018 and June 2020. While
  preferred levels of redistribution have remained largely stable, our results
  indicate major shifts and growing ideological polarization around perceptions
  of welfare state efficiency and capacity, of fiscal constraint, as well as on
  political trust. Hence, the COVID-crisis has so far neither led to a left- nor
  a right-shift in citizens’ desired level of state intervention, but to an
  increasingly polarized context of (re)distributive politics, which is likely
  to imply heightened conflict over economic and social policy in the future."
