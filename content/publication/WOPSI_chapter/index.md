abstract: This chapter sheds light on the role of political parties as social
  investment protagonists, consenters, or antagonists in the reform of labor
  market and family policies in Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Drawing on
  original, hand-coded data of three decades of labor market and family policy
  reforms in Southern Europe, the findings show divergent social investment
  trajectories. While Spain and Portugal have started to develop contours of a
  social investment agenda, little progress has been made in Italy and Greece.
  Programmatic political competition and government partisanship play a role in
  accounting for these divergent trajectories. Center-left parties have acted as
  the primary social investment protagonists in Spain, Portugal, and Italy.
  However, the Italian center-left remains fragmented and has rarely been in
  government. In stark contrast, both center-right and center-left parties in
  Greece have acted as social investment antagonists. Political and economic
  turmoil in the wake of the Eurozone crisis paints a bleak picture for the
  further development of social investment in Southern Europe. Once fiscal
  constraints can eventually be overcome, a core question remains to what extent
  an inclusive social investment coalition can be formed in an ever more
  fragmented political landscape.
