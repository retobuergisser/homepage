Governments constantly face trade-offs. In times of “permanent austerity” (Pierson 1996), resources are scare which presents policy-makers with difficult choices. They have to fear electoral punishment because existing research shows that citizens support most forms of government spending, while they oppose taxation or government debt. Yet, we know very about public opinion towards trade-offs. Therefore, my research shifts the focus from peoples’ preferences towards peoples’ priorities.

First, in a joint research project, Björn Bremer and I study public opinion towards (i) fiscal policies (including government spending, taxation, and government debt) and (ii) social policies (including various forms of social investment and social consumption). The research project brings together our substantive interests in the politics of fiscal policies and the welfare state and it uses original conjoint and split-sample survey experiments in four European countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) to capture the multidimensionality of fiscal and social policies. Disentangling the preferences towards different policies in this way allows us to analyse the citizens’ priorities when they are confronted with some of the trade-offs that are inherent in policy-making.

Second, I have recently joined the ERC Welfare Priorities project, directed by Silja Häusermann at the University of Zurich, where I continue to work on social policy preferences and priorities with a wonderful team of researchers. Currently, we have a working paper on atttitudes towards the redistributive role of the state have polarized in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. In the future, we will explore the mechanism behind solidaristic reforms that aim to expand benefits and services to people who are worse-off (e.g., those coping with precarious employment and old-age poverty, immigrants).
