### Joint Work with Klaus Armingeon and Isabelle Stadelmann-Steffen 

Transitioning from fossil fuels and nuclear energy to a renewable energy age is a challenge for many industrialized countries. One of the main concerns is how to implement and promote new technologies and solutions politically. In this context, many countries have introduced “soft policies” (Carattini et al. 2017), for instance, voluntary self-regulation (Baranzini and Thalmann 2004; Ingold 2008) or traditional subsidies for renewable energies (Marcantonini and Ellerman 2014), which, however, are either not effective enough in terms of goal attainment or financially very expensive. By contrast, incentive-based steering mechanisms (e.g., incentives or environmental taxes) are widely acknowledged to be the most effective and economically efficient instruments, since they generate continuous and long-term incentives for environmentally friendly innovation and practices (Carattini et al. 2017; Deroubaix and Lévèque 2006; Jaffe et al. 2002; Perry and Williams 1999; Rausch and Karplus 2014; Vollebergh 2007). Moreover, some researchers have argued for the economic advantages of incentive-based approaches (Carrattini et al. 2017; OECD 2008; Rausch et al. 2014). However, especially ecological taxes have been shown to be particularly difficult to implement politically, whereas conventional regulatory approaches (i.e., rules and bans) tend to be more popular for purposes of practical implementation (Felder and Schleiniger 2002; Kirchgässner and Schneider 2003). Moreover, voters seem to prefer policies of regulation and prohibition over market-oriented policies (Kirchgässner and Schneider 2003, p. 375; Stadelmann-Steffen 2011).

Scholars have demonstrated that the cost perceptions that characterize incentive-based policy instruments are a fundamental reason for their unpopularity. Based on the public choice approach, Kirchgässner and Schneider (2003, p. 375) have argued that with respect to environmental policy, voters generally must choose between a better quality environment (in the future) and a higher real income today, and they tend to prefer the latter (see also Bornstein and Lanz 2008). Moreover, the individual cost-benefit calculation may be biased towards traditional regulatory policies in which costs are less visible to voters compared to incentive-based instruments: “voters may have the impression that an improvement of the environment could be reached by means of regulations and prohibitions without costs, i.e., without reducing the income of the average citizen” (Kirchgässner and Schneider 2003, p. 375). That “cost-illusion” (Schulz 2011) implies that traditional policies are perceived to be more equitable and fairer (Deroubaix and Lévèque 2006, p. 947).

Thus, the nature of ecological taxes in particular lead to a situation in which the costs related to a policy proposal are immediately tangible and visible for individual households, whereas the potential benefits of these instruments are much less so. We aim to investigate two specific but crucial aspects that could influence support for ecological taxes: 

1. Does visible compensation increase support of ecological taxes?
By compensation we mean that an ecological tax could generate some benefits for individuals. These can be material benefits (e.g., if the revenues of ecological tax is redistributed to the population, especially households with low energy/electricity consumption could profit), or immaterial benefits (e.g., if a tax is effective and leads to a desired outcome). To investigate the role of visible compensation we propose two survey elements: a conjoint analysis and an information treatment. In the conjoint analysis we want to investigate if benefits of ecological taxes increase support, i.e., are able to compensate the costs, if they are made more explicit and visible to respondents. In their earlier conjoint analyses on the support of renewable energy policies, Stadelmann and Dermont (2018) did not specify how tax revenues could be used or redistributed. In contrast, in the conjoint analysis proposed for this study, we describe specific benefits like a reduction of the health insurance costs or funding of the first pillar of the pension scheme. Moreover, we assign an information treatment, which provides one group of respondents with information on the material and immaterial benefits of ecological taxes, whereas the control group does not receive such information. This design enables us to study how knowledge about the efficacy of ecological taxes increases the visibility of their benefits, and thereby increases public support.

2. Does information and knowledge on the economic mechanisms behind ecological taxes increase individual beliefs in the efficacy of these instruments, and eventually increase their popular support?
Thus, this second question particularly considers and tests our conclusion from previous research, that a lack of information and knowledge about policy effects and erroneous beliefs in the efficacy of ecological taxes is one of the main reasons why these instruments are unpopular.
