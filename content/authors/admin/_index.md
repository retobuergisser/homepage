### Welcome!

I am Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Political Science, University of Zurich. Prior to joining the IPZ, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern. I hold a Ph.D. from the European University Institute.

I work at the intersection of political economy, comparative politics, and political behavior. I am particularly interested in the politics of welfare state and labor market reforms, fiscal and environmental policy preferences, technological change, and growth models. In my Ph.D., I have studied the politics of welfare state recalibration in Continental and Southern Europe over the last three decades. Currently, I am part of the [NORFACE TECHNO](https://techno-norface.net/) and the [ERC Welfare Priorities](http://welfarepriorities.eu) projects.
