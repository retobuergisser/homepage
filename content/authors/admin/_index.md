I am Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Political Science, University of Zurich. I hold a Ph.D. from the European University Institute and have been a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern. 

My main research interests lie in the fields of political economy, comparative politics, and political behavior. I am particularly interested in social and fiscal policy preferences, technological change, and the politics of social and economic policy reforms. In my Ph.D., I have studied the politics of welfare state recalibration in Continental and Southern Europe over the last three decades.
