### Welcome!

I am Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Political Science, University of Zurich. I hold a Ph.D. from the European University Institute and have been a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern. 

My main research interests lie in the fields of political economy, comparative politics, and political behavior. I am particularly interested in the politics of welfare state and labor market reforms, fiscal and environmental policy preferences, technological change, and growth models. In my Ph.D., I have studied the politics of welfare state recalibration in Continental and Southern Europe over the last three decades. Currently, I am also part of the [ERC Welfare Priorities](http://welfarepriorities.eu) and the [NORFACE TECHNO project](https://www.norface.net/project/techno/).
