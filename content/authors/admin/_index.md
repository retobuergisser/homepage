### Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at the University of Vienna. Previously,  I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Political Science (IPZ) at the University of Zurich and in the Institute of Political Science (IPW) at the University of Bern. I hold a Ph.D. from the European University Institute.

My research sits at the intersection of political economy, comparative politics, and political behavior. I study how governments manage the digital and green transitions, how citizens perceive and evaluate inclusive and sustainable economic, social, and environmental policies, and the broader social and political consequences of these interventions.
